2 Sequence Diagrams:

1) "Call In" assigned to Leon Geitmann
Description:

The inbound call of course starts with a customer calling our insitution, where he gets connected to the CMC.
Here a purchase likelihood score is assigned to the customer, based on info gathered from the call itsself 
(location, suburb, prefix, already purchased a product from this phone number in the past, etc.). The CMC then 
requests the skill scores of the RMs currently available. The skill score for each RM are being calculated automatically
based on their recent performance. The best fitting RM will be assigned to each calling customer (high skill score matched
with high purchase-likelihood-score). The RM and calling customer get connected and the customer will hopefully purchase one 
of our products.

2) "Call Out" assigned to Leon Geitmann

Every Diagram will be sent to Junkai Li who will visualize each in VISIO in order to have consistent graphics / Diagrams.
