11.05.2020 - Creation and Distribution of Work Models:

2 Use Case Diagrams:

1) RM calls potential customer ("Call Out") assigned to Ding Sun
2) Interested Customer calls RM to buy holiday package ("Call In") assigned to Aung Myat


2 Activity Diagrams:

1) "Call In" assigned to Junkai Li
Description:
Inbound calls begin when the customer dials CMC. As the call is held by CMC, the information starts to calculate the customers
score to determined who will be served first(High score will be served first, lower score will keep on waiting until RM respond).
If no RM responded the call, all customer who is on hold will be transferred to the interactive voice response(IVP) unit.

2) "Call Out" assigned to Mofan Heng


2 Sequence Diagrams:

1) "Call In" assigned to Leon Geitmann
Description:
The inbound call of course starts with a customer calling our insitution, where he gets connected to the CMC.
Here a purchase likelihood score is assigned to the customer, based on info gathered from the call itsself 
(location, suburb, prefix, already purchased a product from this phone number in the past, etc.). The CMC then 
requests the skill scores of the RMs currently available. The skill score for each RM are being calculated automatically
based on their recent performance. The best fitting RM will be assigned to each calling customer (high skill score matched
with high purchase-likelihood-score). The RM and calling customer get connected and the customer will hopefully purchase one 
of our products.

2) "Call Out" assigned to Leon Geitmann
Description:
The RM is ready to call a potential customer and therefore requests a call, including customer details from the CMC. The CMC 
responds with all necessary information and automatically creates a list of potential customers with details for each one. 
After these steps the RM has signaled that he's ready to make outbound calls and has received all necessary information by 
the CMC to make his calls. In the next step the RM therefore calls the potential customer and tries to convince him to buy
one of our holiday packages. When the call is over, the customer will have decided if he/she would like to purchase a product.
The RM will note that decision and notify the CMC if the customer decided to purchase a specific product or make no purchase
at all. After this the RM can call the next potential customer and the sequence begins again.

Every Diagram will be sent to Junkai Li who will visualize each in VISIO in order to have consistent graphics / Diagrams.
