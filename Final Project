1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology) 


1) Problem Definition:

RMs need to be assigned to the best fitting customer. Therefore, the Information System needs to provide assistance to RMs in serving 
their potential end-customers and needs to match RMs and endcustomers according to RMs skills and customers profiles. A customer that 
wants to know specific information about a specific holiday package would need to be assigned to an RM that has the knowledge and can 
answer the customers questions. Further matching techniques such as taking into account as much customer info as possible (for example 
social, cultural, financial and more backgroundinformation of the customers) and making the best use of it should reflect a strategic 
approach of the Information System. Many considerable variables form the main problem of matching RMs and customers as best as possible.
A strategic approach is needed to solve this problem and to achieve substantial improvements for the business through our new Information
System. 



2) Objectives of the Project:

The objective of the project is to use a design thinking approach paired with the agile methodology of using Scrum as a team to address
the problem stated above. Workproducts, models, artefacts (for example UML-Diagrams) and tools (for example Github) will be used in order
to collaboratively tackle the problem. Another objective will be do document the progress of the team and to later present the results
and solutions, including descriptions of UML-Diagrams describing how the components of the Information System will interact with each other
and how the IS will provide the solution to the challenges and problems. The main objective of the Information System itsself will be to 
implement mutliple improvements to the already existing CallManagementCentre (CMC). The explicit challenges derive from the requirements 
given beforehand. Some of the main details include adjusting the call-flow rate to suitable Relationship-Managers (including matching 
techniques for RM & customers (inbound & outbound calls)), redirecting inbound customers to an InteractiveVoiceRespone-System (IVR)
and to find more, new ways to assisst RMs during their daily task of selling holiday packages.
