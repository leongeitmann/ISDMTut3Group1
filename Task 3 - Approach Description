In the Customer point of view,the interactive voice response(IVR) unit of the call management centre(CMC) result in a long
waiting time and hard to hear the unclear voice ,whcih it cause a loss of satisfaction and patient to the customer.The collects 
of information about customers' preferences and culture might infringe customers privacy. Also, the speed of responding 
time depends on the customer rating system causes an unfair treatment to the customer.


The features of system automatic dialling might disrupt the work rhythm of the relationship managers and result in 
an increased workload and low efficiency of work. The incorrect collection of relationship managers' detail might 
lead to the wrong information record in profile and a skill matrix, and final cause the system matched the relationship 
manager to the wrong customer.


In this system, a lot of RM information needs to be collected and matched with the user's information.
As the number of users increases, the time and energy required to manage the data will increase. If the data is not managed properly,
the user's information will easily be leaked


Ideate
