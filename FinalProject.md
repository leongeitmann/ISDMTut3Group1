**1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology)** (Leon Geitmann)


**1.1) Problem Definition:** 

RMs need to be assigned to the best fitting customer. Therefore, the Information System needs to provide assistance to RMs in serving their potential end-customers and needs to match RMs and endcustomers according to RMs skills and customers profiles. A customer that wants to know specific information about a specific holiday package would need to be assigned to an RM that has the knowledge and can answer the customers questions. Further matching techniques such as taking into account as much customer info as possible (for example social, cultural, financial and more backgroundinformation of the customers) and making the best use of it should reflect a strategic approach of the Information System. Many considerable variables form the main problem of matching RMs and customers as best as possible.A strategic approach is needed to solve this problem and to achieve substantial improvements for the business through our new Information System. 


**1.2) Objectives of the Project:**

The objective of the project is to use a design thinking approach paired with the agile methodology of using Scrum as a team to address the problem stated above. Workproducts, models, artefacts (for example UML-Diagrams) and tools (for example Github) will be used in order to collaboratively tackle the problem. Another objective will be do document the progress of the team and to later present the results and solutions, including descriptions of UML-Diagrams describing how the components of the Information System will interact with each other and how the IS will provide the solution to the challenges and problems. The main objective of the Information System itsself will be to implement mutliple improvements to the already existing CallManagementCentre (CMC). The explicit challenges derive from the requirements given beforehand. Some of the main details include adjusting the call-flow rate to suitable Relationship-Managers (including matching techniques for RM & customers (inbound & outbound calls)), redirecting inbound customers to the InteractiveVoiceRespone-System (IVR) and to find more, new ways to assisst RMs during their daily task of selling holiday packages. 



**2. Stakeholders** (Aung Myat)

Stakeholder 1: RM (Relationship Manager, they sell the holiday packages to customers)

Stakeholder 2: Customer (Buy Holiday Packages, aligned to best fitting RM)

Stakeholder 3: IT Employee (work on system)

Stakeholder 4: Project developers team (supporting in development of system)

Stakeholder 5: CEO and organization (sponsoring the project)

Stakeholder 6: Shareholders of organization (benefits according to the success of project)

Stakeholder 7: Potential customers (people who want to know about the holiday packages)
Stakeholder 8: Maintenance team (to maintain the system)

Stakeholder 9: Hotels and resorts (can benefit from success of system)

Stakeholder 10: Government (benefits from tax of customers)

Stakeholder 11: Telecommunications company（decrease the cost of call）

**3.2 Define**

In the Customer point of view,the interactive voice response(IVR) unit of the call management centre(CMC) result in a long waiting time and hard to hear the unclear voice ,whcih it cause a loss of satisfaction and patient to the customer.The collects of information about customers' preferences and culture might infringe customers privacy. Also, the speed of responding time depends on the customer rating system causes an unfair treatment to the customer.

The features of system automatic dialling might disrupt the work rhythm of the relationship managers and result in an increased workload and low efficiency of work. The incorrect collection of relationship managers' detail might lead to the wrong information record in profile and a skill matrix, and final cause the system matched the relationship manager to the wrong customer.

In this system, a lot of RM information needs to be collected and matched with the user's information. As the number of users increases, the time and energy required to manage the data will increase. If the data is not managed properly,the user's information will easily be leaked


**3.3 Ideate**
Problem:a long waiting time and hard to hear the unclear voice. 
Solution:Categorize problems and set up some that most customers might encounter, and set up a human service if the problem is not solved.

Problem:The features of system automatic dialling might cause an increased workload and low efficiency of work. 
Solution: The RM worker can set his own working state in the system, and if the RM worker is already working, the system will automatically skip his selection.

Problem:Customers' information may be leaked.
Solution: The privacy information of users to take encryption measures to prevent users from being harassed because of information disclosure.

**4. Scrum Methodology and Activities** (Aung Myat, Leon Geitmann)

In the project, the team has used framework of Scrum to accomplish the software development documentation. 

The use of Scrum framework is varied to an extent since not all the requirements are met for the framework. In case of three roles in Scrum, the project description is considered as the product owner as all the changes and requirements are given in the description. For the development team, all the team members contribute as part of the development team. There is no fixed Scrum master because we all work as the same and manage together in order to let everyone experience the all the roles of Scrum. The sprint period is changed to one week and the team members ensure to finish assigned tasks within one week (upload by saturday, discuss sprint review and assign new tasks on monday). We break down the assignment tasks to multiple small tasks which we each hould be able to finish in one sprint (monday to saturday). If one task of the assignment is considered as a product backlog, each broken down task represents a sprint backlog. We make sure to finish our assigned tasks every sprint and no new one is assigned during the sprint. If one task can not be finished within one sprint, it gets added to the to-do list of the next sprint. Most Scrum events are combined to one event with almost one and a half hour of time. We used tutorial time as the combined Sprint planning, Sprint review and Sprint retrospective event. All the discussion, evaluations, and assigning are done in one time. dince not all members is available everyday to make daily Scrum, we avoid to do the daily scrum meeting but communicate as much as needed via Microsoft Teams. Our scrum meeting (including sprint retrospective meeting followed by the planning of the next sprint) is done on every Monday at tutorial time, which is about one and a half hours long. We discuss what we are going to finish and what we have finished. We evaluate our outputs and give feedback to each other. 

Regarding to the artefacts of Scrum, all the product backlogs are given in the description of product owner, which are required tasks for the assignment document. We created files of product backlogs in github to complete our work and issues are created in order to break the product backlog down into smaller tasks which are sprint backlogs, accomplished every week. Every week, each member needs to finsih the assigned task, which he decides to finish on that week and upload into the respective files. 

This is the product increment of our team in Scrum framework. The progress is documented in github using the "project" section, so that every member can look at the board (similiar to KanBan) and see what the others are working on, what is done and what is left to do. Each member is responsible for updating the state of their tasks on that board. 


**5. Systems Analysis Assumption** (Leon Geitmann)

5.1) Inbound calls: 
All Inbound calls are from customers who are interested in buying a holiday package and need to be assigned to a RM that is best fitted for each customer. No In-Bound call has a different matter other than buying a holiday package. Therefore, inbound calling customers will not have to be convinced by RMs to buy a holiday package, but rather need to have their questions answered or assisted in choosing which holiday package to purchase.

5.2) Outbound calls:
All Outbound calls are from RMs to potential customers, in which RMs aim to convince their interlocuters / conversation partner to buy a holiday package. For this, the RM needs to be convincing quickly before the potential customer loses interest and hangs up. Therefore, a time frame for the RM will be created, in which he needs to convey his message (for example advantages of holiday packages) and convince the customer. This time frame has been put to 2 Minutes. If he has not conveyed his message or convinced the customer in that time, the potential customer will hang up and the conversation will be over. In that case, the next potential customer is called and the process repeats itsself. 

5.3) An already existing "Profiler Tool" creates profiles of all customers based on postcode and surnames and segments them into social and financial segments which we assume to be correct in order to match each customer with the best RM possible. It is assumed that the Profiler Tool can therefore aid in assigning "potential buy scores" to inbound calling customers through recognizing where the customer lives (and therefore being able to differentiate between lower and higher income areas, helping to evaluate customers).

**6.2 Use Case Diagrams:**

6.2.1) Call In (Aung Myat)

![Usu Case Call in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62220299/82973433-b6853b00-a01a-11ea-969c-c0b07855e53e.PNG)

Description:
Since use case diagrams show the black box view of a system, a couple of features that are used by relationship managers and generated automatically from the system in order to use in making a contact from customer to relationship manager. The features are selected according to the given description whcih should be essential to the system of call management centre. In order to make the calls better and get more customer satisfaction, some new customer services are added. For example, if the customer cannot wait too long for a free relationship manager, the system will take the record of the customer and put the contact in the queue so that the relationship manager is given a reminder to call back the customer if the customer wants to be called back. 

6.2.2) Call Out (Ding Sun)

![Use Case Call Out - Visio Professional 2020_5_16 16_58_32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62220299/82148528-f409fb80-9897-11ea-8a1b-173f21dfeffc.png)


**6.3 Activity Diagrams:**

6.3.1) Call In (Junkai Li)

![call in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53921261/82893119-e3423f80-9f93-11ea-93a7-e74a66865363.png)

Inbound calls begin when the customer dials CMC. As the call is held by CMC, the information starts to calculate the customers score to determined who will be served first(High score will be served first, the lower score will keep on waiting until RM respond). If no RM responded the call, all customer who is on hold will be transferred to the interactive voice response(IVP) unit. In the time with IVP, the customer will be asked to answer a few questions(E.x: Call Reason). The customer could choose to keep waiting or end the call in this stage. RM will be assigned to the customer. hopefully, each customer will purchase our products. This process will start again when another customer called CMC.

6.3.2) Call Out (Mofan Heng)

![call out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53921261/82892695-4384b180-9f93-11ea-9d8f-8efde27688f6.PNG)

Outbound calls begin when the RM requests a calling to customer.The requestiong is held by CMC, then the information starts to calculates RM skils and profile. The information system will creat a customer target list for each RM. The rule of match system is high score RM serves high score customers. ( the class diagram will achieve operation of match) Then, the RM will receive a target list which have matched cuatomer details.(E.g: Name, Product preferences）The customers are able to choose answer the call or not. After the customers picking up, they can purchase products then end call, then the information system will record the performance of RM in the call and store it for later use.(Better service quality of RM is able to win more scores) If the customer does not answer the call, end the call.


**6.4 Sequence Diagrams** 

6.4.1) Call In (Leon Geitmann)

![Sequence Diagram Inbound Call - Visio Professional 2020_5_16 15_39_35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62220299/82118930-a4ef9800-97bd-11ea-8e0a-3879931ef563.png)

The inbound call of course starts with a customer calling our insitution, where he gets connected to the CMC. Here a purchase likelihood score is assigned to the customer, based on info gathered from the call itsself (location, suburb, prefix, already purchased a product from this phone number in the past, etc.). The CMC then requests the skill scores of the RMs currently available. The skill score for each RM are being calculated automatically based on their recent performance. The best fitting RM will be assigned to each calling customer (high skill score matched with high purchase-likelihood-score). The RM and calling customer get connected and the customer will hopefully purchase one of our products.

6.4.2) Call Out (Leon Geitmann)

![Sequence Diagram Outbound Call - Visio Professional 2020_5_16 16_04_46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62220299/82118946-ade06980-97bd-11ea-94a3-b75caa3287d0.png)

The RM is ready to call a potential customer and therefore requests a call, including customer details from the CMC. The CMC responds with all necessary information and automatically creates a list of potential customers with details for each one. After these steps the RM has signaled that he's ready to make outbound calls and has received all necessary information by the CMC to make his calls. In the next step the RM therefore calls the potential customer and tries to convince him to buy one of our holiday packages. When the call is over, the customer will have decided if he/she would like to purchase a product. The RM will note that decision and notify the CMC if the customer decided to purchase a specific product or make no purchase at all. After this the RM can call the next potential customer and the sequence begins again.



** 7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails**

**7.1 Competitive Advantages**

The implementation of the new information system into the in-house call management centre (CMC) could bring several benefits to the organisation and help in it to gain an important competetive advantage. The introduction of the information system will provide the Relationship managers’ profile, their skill matrix and customers’ information for the CMC to select the end-customers for providing a better quality server to the customer. This way, more valuable customers are guaranteed to be served in a shorter time. This aims to serve the most valued customers as best as possible, which can ensure to keep them as a satisfied customer. 

The CMC’s Information system enhances the data access to alleviate the time spent on the harassing call and customer selecting to enhanced the overall efficiency, creates better sales and brings more value to the business. The Interactive Voice Response unit (IRP) and Automatic Number Identification does an caller authentication to the calls to improve the security and handle the overflow calls to increase the communication and increased customers' satisfaction at the same time. It could reduce the cost from reducing the average calling time and number of employees required in order to provide more funds to the business.


**7.2 Adverse Effects**
 
Technological progress has brought countless benefits to the business, but an IT failure would be a disaster for the enterprises. The failure of the information system could bring a massive impact to the business, employee and the customer. The first impact is the loss of customers and market share, as the information system failure happened relationship managers would no longer get the support from it. It will lead the customer called an unprepared and unprofessional relationship managers and result in an unsatisfactory reply to the customer, which it will caused huge market and financial loss to the business. Continued with it, as the information system failure occurs, business will need to spend lots of time and manpower to solve it until it resumes operation. Every minute of the system downtime would cause a significant drop of the work efficiency and increase financial costs. After the information system goes back online, the high investment on solving the IT failures might cause the business to fire a large range of employees to maintain the business as normal. The missing or corrupted data might also occur after the IT failures, the loss or damage of RM and customers' detail will takes a long time to resolve.
