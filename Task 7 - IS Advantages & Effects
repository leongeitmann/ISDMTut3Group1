system project fails

Competitive Advantages

The implementation of the new information system into the in-house call management centre (CMC) could bring 
several benefits to the organisation and help in it to gain an important competetive advantage. The introduction of 
the information system will provide the Relationship managers’ profile, their skill matrix and customers’ 
information for the CMC to select the end-customers for providing a better quality server to the customer. This way,
more valuable customers are guaranteed to be served in a shorter time. This aims to serve the most valued customers 
as best as possible, which can ensure to keep them as a satisfied customer. 

The CMC’s Information system enhances the data access to alleviate the time spent on the harassing call and 
customer selecting to enhanced the overall efficiency, creates better sales and brings more value to the business. The
Interactive Voice Response unit (IRP) and Automatic Number Identification does an caller authentication to the calls to 
improve the security and handle the overflow calls to increase the communication and increased customers' satisfaction at 
the same time. It could reduce the cost from reducing the average calling time and number of employees required in order to 
provide more funds to the business.


Adverse Effects
 
Technological progress has brought countless benefits to the business, but an IT failure would be a disaster for the 
enterprises. The failure of the information system could bring a massive impact to the business, employee and the 
customer. The first impact is the loss of customers and market share, as the information system failure happened 
relationship managers would no longer get the support from it. It will lead the customer called an unprepared and 
unprofessional relationship managers and result in an unsatisfactory reply to the customer, which it will caused huge 
market and financial loss to the business. Continued with it, as the information system failure occurs, business will 
need to spend lots of time and manpower to solve it until it resumes operation. Every minute of the system downtime would
cause a significant drop of the work efficiency and increase financial costs. After the information system goes back 
online, the high investment on solving the IT failures might cause the business to fire a large range of employees to 
maintain the business as normal. The missing or corrupted data might also occur after the IT failures, the loss or damage 
of RM and customers' detail will takes a long time to resolve.
