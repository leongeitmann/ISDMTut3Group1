1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology) 


1) Problem Definition:

RMs need to be assigned to the best fitting customer. Therefore, the Information System needs to provide assistance to RMs in serving 
their potential end-customers and needs to match RMs and endcustomers according to RMs skills and customers profiles. A customer that 
wants to know specific information about a specific holiday package would need to be assigned to an RM that has the knowledge and can 
answer the customers questions. Further matching techniques such as taking into account as much customer info as possible (for example 
social, cultural, financial and more backgroundinformation of the customers) and making the best use of it should reflect a strategic 
approach of the Information System. This needs to be done with the including the "Profiler Tool". The overall problem that the IS aims 
to solve is to find the best pairs of customer-RM-matches, meaning that each customer should get connected to the RM that is the best 
suited for the individual (potential) customer. 



2) Objectives of the Project:

The objective of the project is to use a design thinking approach paired with the agile methodology of using Scrum as a team to address
the problem stated above. Workproducts, models, artefacts and tools such as GitHub will be used in order to collaboratively tackle
problem. Another objective will be do document the progress of the team and to later present the results and solutions, including 
descriptions of UML-Diagrams describing how the components of the Information System will interact with each other and how the IS will 
provide the solution to the challenges and problems.
